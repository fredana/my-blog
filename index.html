            <h1>MY MEMORABLE JOURNEY INTO IT WORLD</h1>
            <h2>How Everything Started</h2>
            <p>My passion for the tech world started more than 15 years ago, around 2001. I was in 4th year of high school. 
                Where I come from (West Africa), IT was not quite developed. So, this dream of understanding how these computers worked 
                stayed with me until around 2007 when I started college. But unfortunately, I could not concretize it...</p>
            <p>It was only a few years after my arrival in the USA that I was able to fully "throw my feet together" in the field of tech and 
                begin to really learn the basic components of a web page, in particular HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT ( the three main "ingredients" of 
                a web page presentation).</p>
                <p>In the following lines, we will see in a basic way what importance these two major "ingredients" represent and what roles 
                    they play in the creation of a web page.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Definitions</h2>
                <p>A webpage is like a human body structure: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>The skeleton: HTML</li>
                        <li>Flesh/Clothing: CSS</li>
                        <li>The functioning of the organs: JAVASCRIPT</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Let's take an overview look at each element. </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>HTML</b></li>
                    <p>The <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage (HTML) is the code that is used to structure a web page and 
                        its content. HTML uses tags to define the structure and meaning of content on a web page. It is composed of three main elements:
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Html</em>: contains the entire HTML document.</li><br><br>
                            <img src="images/htmlTag.png" alt=""><br><br>
                            <img src="images/htmlTagClosed.png" alt=""><br><br>
                            <li><em>Head</em>: contains any metadata describing the document.</li><br><br>
                            <img src="images/headTag.png" alt=""><br><br>
                            <li><em>Body</em>: is the second child of the "html" element. it is what is displayed on a web page when opened. Everything that 
                                we want the view to see is coded into the "body" section (called opening and closing tags "<", and "/>")</li><br><br>
                            <img src="images/bodyTag.png" alt=""><br><br>
                            <li><em>Footer</em>: is the section used to add a note at the bottom of a page, but it is not a "must use" element.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Here is an example of what a basic HTML document setup looks like (source: w3schools.com):<br><br>
                        <img src="images/setup.png" alt=""><br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>To create an HTML file: <br> Open a text editor (such as Notepad, Sublime Text, or Visual Studio Code) and create a new file. 
                        Save it with a .html extension, for example, index.html. This will be your main HTML file.</p>
                    <li><b>CSS</b></li>
                    <p>The <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heet (CSS) allows you to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of your web 
                        pages. CSS works in conjunction with HTML to separate the content and structure of a web page from its presentation. <br><br>
                    </p>
                    <p>There are three main ways of implementing a CSS file into a HTML document:</p><br><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inline CSS: You can apply CSS styles directly to individual HTML elements by using the style attribute. For example:</li><br><br>
                        <img src="" alt="">
                        <li>Internal CSS: You can define CSS styles within the '<em><b>style</b></em>' tags in the '<em><b>head</b></em>' section of your HTML document. 
                            This method applies styles to all elements on the page. For example:</li><br><br>
                            <img src="" alt=""><br><br>
                        <li>External CSS: The recommended approach is to create a separate CSS file with a .css extension and link it to your HTML file using 
                            the '<em><b>link</b></em>' tag. This allows you to keep your styles separate from your HTML code and apply the same styles to multiple pages. 
                            For example:</li><br><br>
                            <img src="" alt=""><br><br>
                            <p>CSS Selectors: CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styles to them. There are various types of selectors, 
                                such as element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, and more. For example:</p><br><br>
                            <img src="" alt="">
                    </ul>
                    <li><b>JAVASCRIPT</b></li>
                    <p>JavaScript is primarily used in web development but can also be used for other types of applications, such as server-side development or 
                        desktop applications. It allows you to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to your web pages</p>
                    <p>It One of the primary uses of JavaScript in web development is manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM). 
                        The DOM represents the structure of an HTML document, and JavaScript allows you to access, modify, and interact with the elements and 
                        content of a web page dynamically. You can change the content, style, and attributes of HTML elements, create new elements, handle events, 
                        and more.</p>
                    <p>avaScript is supported by all major web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, browser compatibility can vary, 
                        so it's important to test your code across different browsers and versions.</p>
